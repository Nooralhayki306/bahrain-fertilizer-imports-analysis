# Bahrain Fertilizer Imports Analysis (2020–2024)

## Project Overview
Between **2020 and 2024**, Bahrain spent around **6 million Bahraini Dinars (BD)** on fertilizer imports, reflecting notable fluctuations in import activity over time.  
This project analyzes how import values, quantities, and supplier dynamics evolved during that period — uncovering key patterns in **fertilizer types, trade partners, and seasonal demand**.  
The dashboard was built in **Power BI** to transform raw trade data into clear, data-driven insights supporting agricultural and economic decision-making.

---

## Objectives
The analysis aims to answer the following key questions:

1. **How have Bahrain’s fertilizer import values changed over time (2020–2024)?**  
2. **Which fertilizer commodities contribute most to Bahrain’s total import quantity and value?**  
3. **Is there a seasonal pattern in animal and vegetable fertilizer imports throughout the year?**  
4. **Which countries are the primary suppliers of fertilizers to Bahrain?**

## Data Description
**Source:** Bahrain import data from 2020–2024 (merged dataset)  
**Size:** ~5 years of trade records  

**Main Columns**
- `DATE`  
- `Country Name`  
- `Commodity / SUBCATEGORY`  
- `Import Value (BD)` / `Import Value (USD)`  
- `Import Quantity`  
- `Import Weight (KG)`  
- `HS_Key` and `UN code` for classification

## Dashboard Features

| Visualization | Purpose |
|----------------|----------|
| **KPI Cards** | Show total import value (6M BD), total quantity (39M kg), and number of supplier countries (34). |
| **Line Chart** | Displays annual trend of fertilizer import value (2020–2024). |
| **Bar Chart (by Country)** | Identifies top supplier countries — mainly Saudi Arabia and Jordan. |
| **Combo Chart (by Commodity)** | Compares import quantity and value across fertilizer types. |
| **Monthly Distribution Chart** | Highlights seasonality in animal/vegetable fertilizer imports. |

---

## Key Insights
- Import values **peaked around 2022**, likely due to global price pressures or higher demand.  
- **Animal or vegetable fertilizers** and **potassium chloride** are the leading imported commodities by both value and quantity.  
- **Saudi Arabia and Jordan** dominate as Bahrain’s main fertilizer suppliers, showing regional dependency.  
- **Seasonal patterns** indicate increased imports during agricultural planting periods (March–May).  

---

## Conclusions
The analysis demonstrates how Bahrain’s fertilizer imports fluctuate due to both **market forces** and **seasonal agricultural cycles**.  
It highlights a dependency on a few regional suppliers and the need for **data-driven trade strategies** to maintain supply stability and cost efficiency.

---

## Recommendations
1. **Encourage Local Production:** Invest in small-scale fertilizer blending or manufacturing facilities to lower import reliance.  
2. **Promote Sustainable Fertilizer Use:** Encourage efficient application methods to reduce wastage and preserve resources.
